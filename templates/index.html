    <h1>Diabetes Prediction Web App</h1>
    <p>
        This web application helps predict whether a person is diabetic based on specific health-related factors. The model, trained on real-world data, aims to assist in the early diagnosis of diabetes. Detecting diabetes early allows for better management and prevention of further complications.

    <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
    <p>
        Diabetes is a condition in which the body cannot effectively process blood sugar (glucose), leading to high blood glucose levels. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps regulate glucose in the body, but in people with diabetes, this process is disrupted.
